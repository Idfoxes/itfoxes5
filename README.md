I'm Danya, I'm 15, I started studying programming with a course on website layout (css+html) in 2021, but somehow I wasn't very interested, then I decided to take a course in java, it helped me understand the basics of programming, but I haven't written a single script in java myself. Later, my brother told me that he was going to study c# (I didn't even know about such a language at that time (according to him, it was very difficult)), but after that I was able to figure it out, and took the course 3 times, then my brother bought a course on unity, now I'm actively studying it, I think in a couple of months I can implement your game
